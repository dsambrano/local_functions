# Pokeno Reader

My family was having trouble remembering all the cards suits, so I made this little app to help with that.
It just creates a randomly shuffled deck and reads out the cards using Google's Text to Speech module.
Additionally, since the whole point is that they don't remember all the suits it also shows an images of the card.

TODO:
- Fix `clover` to clubs
- Fix typo, make the suits end in `s`.
- Need to make this a actual app so it can run on any computer instead of requiring the need for python the interpreter.
  - Some possible examples are PyQT, GTK (C), Maybe even a good first RUST project...
  - I am thinking of having a main display with the card show and under just a quit (says pokeno?) and a pause button to start.
  - Later add buttons for each of the games so see which have been called and such
  - Also later add the previously show cards and a check feature where you put in [QH, 4D, 5C, etc] and it checks to confirm that they were called
  - Later, later we could make a thing to know all the pokeno cards and will automatically know who won what (Doubtful)
